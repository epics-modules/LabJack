This module costs $750 and is the same as the LabJack T7 with the following additional features:

-  Each analog input can be software switched between 16-bit and 24-bit ADC, trading off resolution for speed.
-  In 24-bit mode the ADCs support 9 types of thermocouple inputs.
-  WiFi communications (in addition to standard Ethernet and USB).
